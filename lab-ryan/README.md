##Jest Testing and .forEach, .map, .filter, .reduce practice in vanilla JS

###ForEach
*.forEach requires and array and a callback function.
*It will run a callback function 'for each' item in an given array and return a new array from the results of the callback function.

###Map
*.map method requires and array and a callback function.
*.map is a method which opporates in a similar way to .forEach but changes the array into a new form.
*.map runs the callback over each element in a given array and returns a result.

###Filter
*.filter method requires and array and a callback function.
*.filter checks through each item in an array using the callback function and returnsa boolean or null value and returns a new 'filtered' array.

###Reduce
*.reduce requires and array, a callback and an optional state.
*The .reduce method checks each item in the array, uses the callback to reduce the arra to one item and returns the new value.
